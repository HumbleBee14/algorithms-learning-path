# Data Structure and Algorithms Path

This is the data structure and algorithms path for the Mountblue Coding Bootcamp. 

This document covers the topics that needs to be gone through for the whole bootcamp.

The actual practice pedagogy involves starting with solving a given problem that leads to insights that unravel the concepts. 

The challenge is to find practice problems.
